<p class="main">I'm Tesuansey Link. I was born on March 29, 1985 in Hope, Arkansas. I was in band in middle school and played football in high school. After high school I went to Hendrix College for about six and a half years. I enjoy kickball and pro wrestling. I have one sister aged 24 years.</p>

  <h1 class="header">DROPBEARS!</h1>
  <p class="main">The primary prey of Drop Bears are unsuspecting tourists, often Welsh or German but usually US American or Japanese. It is commonly understood that the Bears favour those with cameras, due to the entrancing reflection of the sun's rays from the glass lenses on a typical Aussie scorcher of a day. It is not true that Drop Bears are merely mesmerized by their reflections in the instruments or harbour a conscious or unconscious desire to be photographed. There is no truth in the rarely misquoted assertion that they wish to be "at one with the lens". It is a well known fact that the Australian Government would have banned tourism long ago had it not been for the fact that with no tourists, the drop bears would have been forced to feed on Australians.</p>
